  I created this site to write about my interests: startups and entrepreneurship, design, data-intensive applications,
  functional programming, AR/VR, and machine learning. I like to use computers to solve problems.

  I built this site in [Jekyll][jekyll], and it's hosted for free on [GitHub Pages][gh-pages]. It's open source, so if
  you like it, feel free to fork it on [GitHub][github] and make your own version.
